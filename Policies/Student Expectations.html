    <p>Students who take the course in person are expected to maintain active participation during class meeting times. This course gives the student opportunities to work on whichever available topic interests them, so it is expected that you will choose and focus on a course-related topic during your time in class. Any time spent on pursuits not related to this course will be reflected in your daily participation grade.</p>

    <h2>Spelling, Grammar, Punctuation and Content</h2>

    <p>You are expected to use spelling, grammar and punctuation correctly in any assignment that involves text. You should always answer questions in your own words, and always use complete sentences. Points will be taken off for incorrect spelling, bad grammar, incorrect punctuation and incomplete sentences.</p>

    <h2>Etiquette</h2>

    <p>In an online or blended course, students will be expected to maintain a level of discourse similar to that of an in-person classroom. Correct spelling, grammar and punctuation should be used at all times. In person, students will be expected to abide by school rules and discussion expectations. On written assignments (especially within a game), correct spelling, grammar and punctuation are expected.</p>

    <h2>Your Data</h2>

    <p>Bring your backup drive to class every day. Keep backup copies of your work on it. It is also a good idea to keep a second backup in an online storage service such as Google Drive, Dropbox or Box.net. Unpredictable things happen with computer hard drives, and it is possible that your data could be lost. Having a backup protects you in case things go awry.</p>

    <h2>Plagiarism</h2>

    <p>Plagiarism is absolutely not tolerated. All assignments, including short worksheets, must be written in your own words. Copying and pasting from a website is considered plagiarism and will result in a grade of zero.</p>

    <h2>Discussion</h2>

    <p>Check your discussion posts against this rubric before you submit them.</p>
