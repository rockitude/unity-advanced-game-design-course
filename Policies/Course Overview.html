<p>The purpose of this course is to introduce (or re-introduce) students to games in multiple types of media, and to the video game industry. During the course, students will learn what makes a game a game while they try their hand at creating a game of their own. They will begin by creating a pitch that encapsulates their game idea in a document. They’ll then use that document as a guide while they create their own 3D video game.</p>

<h2>Outline</h2>
<h3>Availabile Quest Chains</h3>
<ul>
<li>Press Start() - Starting quests that introduce students to the course and to 3D GameLab</li>
<li>Game Designer - This quest chain introduces to students to the fundamentals of game design. Students will learn how to break games down into their component parts, differentiate between game genres and platforms and complete game design projects.</li>
<li>Programmer - This quest chain uses Codecademy.com, an online resource for learning programming, to introduce students to the basics of the JavaScript scripting language, which they will be using to automate functions in Unity.</li>
<li>Object Oriented - This quest chain covers the basics of using Unity to design games. Students will learn important terminology and explore the development environment.</li>
<li>Watcher on the Wall - This quest chain covers the use of cameras.</li>
<li>In Control - This quest chain covers components related to character control and input.</li>
<li>Triggerer - This quest chain covers the use of triggers and colliders.</li>
<li>Invaluable Asset - This quest chain explains how to find, create and use outside assets in your game.</li>
<li>Light in the Darkness - This quest chain covers the use of lights.</li>
<li>What’s the Mats? - This quest chain covers materials and textures.</li>
<li>Game Controller - This quest chain covers using scripting to manage user input and automate actions in your game.</li>
</ul>
