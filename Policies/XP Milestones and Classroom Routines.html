    <h2>Classwork and Homework</h2>

    <p>This course uses a Quest-Based Learning model, where you’ll choose what you want to work on and when. Most quests are self paced, and they aren’t due on any specific date. To help you stay on track, you’ll want to use these dates as guidelines:</p>

    <h3>Grading</h3>

    <p>Grading for Game Design and Development is based on a system of earned Experience Points. Students start with zero points at the beginning of the semester and work toward a goal of earning 3000 points.</p>

    <p>Every two to three weeks, progress grades will be posted that indicate how many experience points a student has earned compared to a milestone. After each milestone, the most recent grade describes the student's current progress; earlier milestone grades will still be visible, but do not count.</p>

    <p>The milestone grades that are posted every two weeks indicate how much of the required XP the student has earned. A students who earns exactly the requirement would receive a grade of 100. Students who earn more than the requirement may have grades higher than 100.</p>

    <p><b>Example 1</b>: If a student earned 800 XP out of a required 1000 XP, their grade would be 80%.</p>

    <p><b>Example 2</b>: If a student earned 1500 XP out of a required 1000 XP, their grade would be 150%.</p>

    <p>Files will be submitted using 3D GameLab. The opening series of quests explains the submission process and gives you an opportunity to practice.</p>

    <h3>Student Blogs</h3>

    <p>A blog page will be set up on the course website for each student. These blogs are to be used as directed in your quests. You’ll be writing reflections on them, and you’ll also be responding to other students’ posts.</p>

    <h3>File Names</h3>

    <p>All files should be named using this format:&nbsp;<strong>LastName, FirstName - Assignment</strong><br>
    Files&nbsp;<strong>will not be graded</strong>&nbsp;unless they are named correctly. If your file name is incorrect, your submission will be returned. You’ll have an opportunity to fix the issue before it is rechecked.</p>

    <h3>Late Work</h3>

    <p>Because students will be learning at their own pace, only certain assignments will be considered late if they aren’t handed in on a specific date. This includes reflections about in-class presentations and other time sensitive assignments.</p>

    <p>No points are deducted from late assignments; instead, a maximum point value is assigned for late work (to encourage on-time submission without heavily penalizing students who are struggling).</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Less than two days late: Maximum score of 85</li>

        <li>Three or more days late: Maximum score of 75</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Classroom Demeanor</h3>

    <p>Students will work quietly in class unless otherwise directed. Wasted class time will be timed by Mr. Lipson and students will stay late to make up for time they missed. All projects and quests are individual unless they state otherwise.</p>

    <h3>Office Hours</h3>

    <p>Students who would like extra help or a quiet place to work can see me during my office hours without an appointment. Office hours are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Monday: 2:20 - 3:30</li>

        <li>Tuesday: 2:20 - 3:00</li>

        <li>Wednesday: 2:20 - 3:30</li>

        <li style="list-style: none">In Room 200H</li>
    </ul>

    <p></p>

    <h2>Policies</h2>

    <h3>Late Work</h3>

    <p>Because students will be learning at their own pace, only certain assignments will be considered late if they aren’t handed in on a specific date. This includes reflections about in-class presentations and other time sensitive assignments.</p>

    <p>No points are deducted from late assignments; instead, a maximum point value is assigned for late work (to encourage on-time submission without heavily penalizing students who are struggling).</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Less than two days late: Maximum score of 85</li>

        <li>Three or more days late: Maximum score of 75</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Attendance/Tardiness</h3>

    <p>Don’t skip class. If your absence is unexcused, you will be referred to the main office for discipline and will miss your chance to be graded for any work you were responsible for that day. If your absence is excused, you’re fine - come and see me outside of class to make up your work for full credit. Don’t be late to class. When class begins, I will close the door. If you arrive late, wait outside until I let you in. If you are let in late without a pass, you must serve a 20-minute after-school teacher detention within the next week. If you arrive late with a pass, you’re fine. Just come in and begin working.</p>

    <h3>Mr. Lipson’s Cell Phone Policy</h3>

    <p>As described in the school handbook, students are not allowed to use their cell phones in the academic wings. Student phones must be turned off or set to silent at all times, and must be kept inside your bag or backpack.</p>

    <p>During the last two minutes of the class period, you may remove your cell phone or other allowed device from your bag to enter items into a calendar, to-do list or other productivity application. You MAY NOT make phone calls, send text messages, browse the internet or use unapproved applications. Students who make calls, send texts, etc. will be subject to the normal consequences for using cell phones in class (detention, parent calls, suspension, etc). Before you leave the classroom, you must put the phone away. If you’re caught in the hallway with your phone, the normal rules apply.</p>

    <p>I use my cell phone as an organizer, and I encourage you to do so too. You will sometimes see me take it out during class to add items to a calendar or to-do list. I will not make or respond to phone calls or text messages during class. If you have any questions about this policy, or you’re interested in some information about how to stay organized using your cell phone or other device, please see me after class or feel free to email me at mlipson@natickps.org.</p>

    <h3>Classroom Equipment</h3>

    <p>Be careful with the equipment. If something breaks, let me know as soon as possible so I can get it fixed. Keep your hands to yourself: do not touch other students or the equipment they’re using. This includes computers, mice and keyboards, microphones and other devices. It also includes other students’ files, whether they’re on another computer or your own. Students are expected to provide their own headphones (except in Electronic Music). If you’re unable to bring your own headphones, I have a limited set of headphones that you can borrow.</p>

    <h3>Other Classroom Rules</h3>

    <p>No food or drink is allowed in the room – finish it outside. Focus on your work. Students who avoid work with video games and other distractions will lose their ability to connect to the internet. Be respectful of others. Leave negative comments at the door. Use school-appropriate language, please. A109 is going paperless this year. Please send an email or instant message instead of printing.</p>

    <h3>Final Project</h3>

    <p>For their final project, students will complete a ‘vertical slice’ - a small, fully complete section of a larger game. Examples of vertical slices include game demos and sections of games shown at pre-release press events. Students won’t need to create all of the levels or environments in their game to complete their vertical slice. They can focus on a limited number of assets and ideas while working toward a smaller-scale finished product that can be completed in the allotted time.</p>
