#This Course is Different

Welcome to NHS’s Game Design and Development course. Please keep an open mind, because this class is a little different from anything you’ve taken before.The course itself is a game. If you’ve played any modern video games, you’re probably familiar with some of the elements you’re going to see:

* Quests: You get to decide what to do. Choose the quests that sound interesting, the ones that other students liked or the one you have time to finish.
* Unlockables: The more quests you complete, the more new stuff becomes available for you to do. See if you can unlock it all!
* Experience Points: Earn your way to an A. In other classes, points are subtracted from 100 when you make mistakes. In Game Design, you start with 0 points and earn your way up by completing quests.
* Mastery: Either you’ve learned a skill, or you’re still working on it. That’s how grading works in GDD; when you submit a quest, it’s either approved so you can move on, or returned with a comment so you can keep working on it. No letter grades for individual assignment.
* Badges: Earn a title and some extra XP when you complete a quest chain.
* Achievements: Earn some extra XP whenever you complete a special task, like rating a certain number of quests or completing quests quickly.
* Awards: Get some extra XP from the instructor by going above and beyond and doing something awesome.
* User-Created Content: Students who finish the course can create quests for other students to complete.

To win the course (and earn an A), you’ll need to earn 3000 XP (experience points) and complete a “vertical slice”; that’s game industry lingo for a small piece of a larger game, like a demo.

All of this stuff will be handled automatically by 3D GameLab: our Course Management System. You can access 3D GameLab and work on quests at any time by clicking on the link in the sidebar.

#What Happens When I Win?

When you reach 3000 XP, lots of new quests and opportunities become available. This is something that is actively being worked on. If you have any suggestions for things that should be available after a students wins the course, please send me an email.

##After 3000 XP

* Quest Builder privilege is unlocked – Students can now create quests for other students to complete
* Minecraft quests become available
