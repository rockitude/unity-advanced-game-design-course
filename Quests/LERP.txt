**Description**

When creating scripts for your games, you'll often need to make something happen gradually, such as fading a light or sliding an object into a new position. This requires a variable that changes over time between two values, and Unity has an awesome built-in function that can generate it for us. It's called Lerp(), and it stands for Linear Interpolation. 

Check out this video to learn about what Lerp() can do for you and how to use it:
