Description

One of the first things we learn about scripting in Unity is also one of the most common tasks we'll need to do: find out if a key has been pressed so we can make a decision. We'll do this using the GetKeyDown() function, or something similar like GetButtonDown() or GetAxis(), all of which come from Unity's Input class.

Check out this video for more info on GetButton() and GetKey():
