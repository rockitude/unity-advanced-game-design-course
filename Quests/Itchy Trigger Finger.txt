Description

Colliders and triggers have an important thing in common: they both designate an area, and when an object enters, leaves or remains within the area, something happens. The key difference between them is that solid objects will run into a collider, whereas they'll move through a trigger. 

Triggers aren't created on their own, they start out as colliders. For more information, check out this video:

In your submission, explain the difference between colliders and triggers and give one example of when you would use each one. Then, take two screenshot of a trigger you've created in your game: one of the trigger area in the Scene view (it will be outlined in green) and one of the collider component in the inspector.
