In recent years, lots of websites and applications have started using Tags to help you organize your data: perhaps the most well-known example of this is Twitter, which uses hashtags #likethis to make tweets more easily searchable and organizeable. Unity allows you to apply tags to your objects so you can find and organize them more easily with built-in functions like FindWithTag().
