**Description**

Game Design is a relatively new field, and there is no central authority that dictates what constitutes good design. There are, however, quite a few conventions that most video game designers agree on. In this quest, you'll familiarize yourself with some of these conventions and propose a game that exemplifies them.

For this quest, learn about a new game design principle by reading an article or book, watching a video, listening to a podcast or through any other media you like. Then, write a pitch or simple game design document proposing a game concept that exemplifies the principle you learned about. Explain why this principle is important and how it fits into your game idea.

Here are some resources you can start with. More will be added to the list over time:
