**Description**

You're starting to get familiar with how to create more complex models in Unity; it's time to start thinking about the most common complex model you'll need to create: humanoid characters. Humanoids don't just sit unmoving in your game: they have to be animated and dynamic. Blender is capable of creating animated characters that can be bend and moved through a process called Rigging, which involves applying a bone structure to your character so they can be moved with constraints similar to the way our own bodies move.

Check out this video to learn more about bones and rigging:
