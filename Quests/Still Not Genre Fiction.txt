Description

Genre is an important concept in the gaming world. Video games are especially interesting, as they often distinguish themselves by playing with , or even throwing out, conventional genre descriptions.

Review [this site](http://edtech2.boisestate.edu/michaellipson/502/webquest/task.html) to brush up on your understanding of what defines each popular gaming genre. Remember that popular genres are only a starting point. The industry is still developing, and new genres are created all the time.

When you're done reviewing, play three games (for about 10 minutes each) in three different genres. Write a short reflection for each explaining which genre you think describes it and what game features make the game fit into that genre.
