**Description**

We covered a whole lot of ground in the introductory Game Design course to get you ready to program in Unity, but along the way we glossed over a whole bunch of really important stuff. This quest covers the most important of those omissions: Classes. Classes are a really important part of Object-Oriented Programing (JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language), and we've been lucky enough to be able to skip over them so far because Unity basically handles them for you. 

In this quest, you're going to learn how to create your own classes, complete with their own constructors. 

Watch this video to learn how classes work in Unity:

Create your own class to manage Inventory, as shown in the video. Then, add your own collectible item type to the class. Don't forget to add a parameter to your constructor as well. Paste your code into the submission box when you're finished.
