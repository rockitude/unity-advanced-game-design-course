If you've ever used Photoshop, you might be familiar with the concept of Layers. In an image, you can lay multiple parts of an image on top of each other, edit them separately and merge them when you're done. Unity's layers have a similar concept: by placing our objects onto separate layers, we can define which objects are able to interact with which other objects.
