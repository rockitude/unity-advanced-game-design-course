**Description**

It's time to take a leap into thus-far unexplored territory, at least for us in the NHS Game Design program: creating our own 3D model assets. To do this we're going to use a new application, entirely separate from Unity, called Blender. Blender's primary function is creating 3D-animated movies, but we can use it to create characters and objects that can be easily imported into Unity for use in our games. 

To get started on your Blender journey, begin with this video:
