**Directions**

When you write an instruction in a script, that instruction is carried out by the computer immediately at the time that it's read. Sometimes this isn't ideal, especially when we want to give the computer a task that takes more time to complete than the one frame in which the instruction is read. For these tasks, we'll be using a convenient feature called Coroutines. Coroutines allow us to perform a task that can be set aside and resumed later. They're also convenient for moving objects without polling information using Update(), which improves the efficiency of our code.

Create your own custom coroutine. You can try moving an object around, like in the example, or come up with an idea of your own. Record a screencast of the result of your coroutine, and paste your code in the submission box.
