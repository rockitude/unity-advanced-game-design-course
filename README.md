unity-advanced-game-design-course
=================================

This repository contains all of the material for my quest-based Advanced Game Design course, created at Natick High School in Natick, MA. The course covers game development using [Unity 3D](http://www.unity3d.com) and [Blender](http://www.blender.org). 

Thanks to [Chris Haskell](https://edtech.boisestate.edu/chris-haskell/) at Boise State University for his work on quest-based learning, and to [GoGo Labs](http://www.gogolabs.com) for [3D GameLab](http://portal.3dgamelab.org), which I use to administer the course. 

The course can be adminsitered on whatever platform you like, but 3D GameLab provides for quests, achievements and all of the other features that make the course work.
